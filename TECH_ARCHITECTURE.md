## 1. Architectural Goals

This architecture serves a prototype with one non-negotiable constraint: **everything we build now should be reusable when we replace the mock layer with a real backend.** Concretely, that means:

- Business logic and UI must never directly depend on *how* data is fetched (mock vs. real API). All data access goes through a swappable service layer.
- State shape should already look like the shape a real API would return, so swapping the transport later doesn't force a data-model rewrite.
- No premature infrastructure: no microservices, no Kubernetes, no real backend. A single Next.js application is the entire system.

---

## 2. System Architecture

GuardOn (prototype) is a **single Next.js application** with no real backend. It is conceptually layered as follows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  UI Layer                    │
│   App Router pages, layouts, feature views   │
└───────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                     │ reads/writes
┌───────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│              State Layer (Zustand)            │
│   Domain stores: scheduling, attendance,      │
│   guards, clients, activityLogs, loneWorker,  │
│   notifications, session/auth, ui             │
└───────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                     │ calls
┌───────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│          Mock Service Layer ("API")           │
│   Repository-style functions returning        │
│   Promises, simulated latency, fixture data    │
└───────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                     │ reads
┌───────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│              Fixture / Seed Data               │
│   Deterministic mock JSON: guards, clients,    │
│   sites, shifts, logs, etc.                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Components never call the Mock Service Layer directly for mutations that affect shared state — they go through a store action, which calls the service layer, then updates the store. This mirrors how a real app would dispatch a request and update a client-side cache, so the migration path to a real backend (e.g., swap the Mock Service Layer for `fetch` calls to real REST/GraphQL endpoints) requires no changes to components or stores.

```

**Rule:** A `features/<domain>` folder owns its own components, hooks, and types. Cross-domain UI composition happens at the `app/` route level, not by features importing each other directly. Shared primitives only live in `components/ui` and `components/shared`.

---

## 4. State Management Strategy

**Zustand** is the single source of truth for all client-side state, chosen over Redux/Context for its low boilerplate and good fit for a prototype timeline, while still scaling cleanly into production.

Principles:

1. **One store per domain**, matching the modules in FEATURE_BACKLOG.md (Scheduling, Attendance, Guards, Clients, Activity Logs, Lone Worker, Notifications) plus `useSessionStore` (current user/role — simulated auth) and `useUiStore` (modals, toasts, transient UI state).
2. **Stores expose actions, not setters.** Components call `store.acceptShift(shiftId)`, not `store.setShifts(...)`. The action internally calls the relevant service function, handles loading/error state, and updates the store. This keeps business logic out of components.
3. **Derived state is computed via selectors**, not duplicated into the store. E.g., "open shifts" is derived from `shifts.filter(s => s.status === 'open')`, not maintained as a separate array that can drift out of sync.
4. **Stores never import from `app/` or `components/`.** Dependency direction is strictly: UI → Store → Service → Mock Data.
5. **Async actions follow a consistent shape:** `{ data, isLoading, error }` per resource, so loading/error UI patterns are consistent across the app and translate directly to real-world async query state (this shape is intentionally compatible with future adoption of a library like TanStack Query if desired in production).

---

## 5. Module Boundaries

Each module below is a `features/<name>` folder plus its corresponding store and service:

| Module | Owns | Does Not Own |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduling | Shift CRUD, assignment, accept/reject, open shift marketplace | Attendance state (clock in/out), guard roster data |
| Attendance | Clock in/out, GPS validation step, selfie capture step, attendance status | Shift creation/assignment |
| Lone Worker | Check-in prompts, missed check-in detection, escalation | Activity log content (though check-ins may *include* a log entry) |
| Activity Logs | Log submission, review queue, per-site history | Lone worker check-in scheduling |
| Guards | Guard roster, profile, eligibility/availability | Shift assignment logic (Scheduling reads guard eligibility, but Guards module doesn't assign shifts) |
| Clients | Client roster, site roster, geofence config | Attendance/GPS validation logic (Attendance reads site geofence, but doesn't own it) |
| Notifications | In-app notification feed, read/unread state | The triggering business event itself (other modules raise notifications via a shared dispatch function) |
| Dashboard | Aggregation/presentation of metrics from other modules | Any source-of-truth data; Dashboard is read-only across modules |

This boundary list is the basis for preventing "scattered business logic" — if a change touches scheduling rules, it should only require editing the Scheduling module's store/service/components.

---

## 6. Component Architecture

Three tiers:

1. **Primitives (`components/ui`)** — shadcn/ui components (Button, Dialog, Input, Card, Badge, Tabs, etc.), unmodified or lightly themed. No business logic.
2. **Shared composites (`components/shared`)** — cross-feature patterns built on primitives: `StatusBadge` (shift/attendance status → color+label), `RoleGate` (conditionally renders children based on current role/permission), `EmptyState`, `PageHeader`, `KpiCard`.
3. **Feature components (`features/<domain>/components`)** — domain-aware components like `ShiftCard`, `ClockInFlow`, `GeofenceEditor`. These connect to their domain's store via hooks and compose primitives/shared composites; they do not reach into another domain's store directly.

Page components in `app/` are intentionally thin: they assemble feature components and layout, and contain little to no logic of their own — **"pages render state."**

---

## 7. Route Architecture

The App Router is organized into **role-oriented route groups**, matching the mobile-first/desktop-first split in the PRD:

- `(auth)` — login/role-selection (simulated auth for the prototype).
- `(guard)` — mobile-first: schedule, shift detail, marketplace, check-in, activity submission.
- `(dispatch)` — desktop-first: dashboard, scheduling calendar, attendance monitor, lone-worker escalation, activity log review, guard roster, client/site management.
- `(client)` — desktop+mobile, read-mostly: coverage view, activity summary.

Each route group has its own `layout.tsx` providing the appropriate shell (mobile bottom-nav for guards, desktop sidebar for dispatch/ops, simplified header for clients). A shared `useRoleGuard` hook checks the current simulated session role against the route group and redirects if mismatched, anticipating real middleware-based route protection in production (see SECURITY_ACCESS.md §4).

---

## 8. Data Flow

Standard flow for any user action that mutates state:

1. User interacts with a feature component (e.g., taps "Claim Shift").
2. Component calls a store action (`useSchedulingStore.claimShift(shiftId)`).
3. Store action sets `isLoading: true`, calls the corresponding service function (`schedulingService.claimShift(shiftId)`).
4. Service function simulates network latency (`simulateLatency()`), reads/writes the in-memory mock database, and resolves with a result shaped like a real API response (`{ data, error }`).
5. Store action updates state from the result, sets `isLoading: false`, and — where relevant — pushes a notification via `useNotificationStore`.
6. Components subscribed to that store slice re-render automatically via Zustand.

This flow is intentionally identical in shape to what a real REST integration would look like, so step 4 is the only step that changes when the mock layer is replaced.

---

## 9. API Strategy

The prototype has **no real network calls**. Instead:

- Each domain has a `*.service.ts` file exposing async functions with the same signatures a real API client would have (e.g., `getShifts(filters): Promise<Shift[]>`, `claimShift(id): Promise<Shift>`).
- A shared `services/client.ts` helper provides `simulateLatency(ms?)` and `simulateFailure(rate?)` so the prototype can realistically demonstrate loading and error states without real infrastructure.
- All mock data lives in `mocks/*.json` and is loaded into an in-memory store via `mocks/seed.ts` on app start, acting as a fake "database" for the session.
- Service functions are the **only** files that know data is mocked. Stores and components only see Promises and typed results — exactly what they'd see calling a real backend.

**Migration path to production:** replacing the contents of each `*.service.ts` file with real `fetch`/API client calls (same function signatures) should require zero changes to stores, hooks, or components. This is the single most important architectural decision in this document, because it's what makes the prototype's code reusable rather than throwaway.

---

## 10. Future Scalability Notes

These are explicitly **not built now**, but the current architecture is designed not to block them:

- **Real backend:** A Node-based API (e.g., NestJS) or a managed BaaS, with PostgreSQL as the system of record. The relational shape (Guards, Clients, Sites, Shifts, Attendance Records, Activity Logs) is already implied by the mock data structures, easing schema design later.
- **Real authentication:** Replace `useSessionStore`'s simulated login with a real provider (e.g., NextAuth, Clerk, or Auth0), issuing real session tokens and enforcing role checks server-side (see SECURITY_ACCESS.md).
- **Real-time updates:** Dispatcher attendance/lone-worker views will eventually need live updates (websockets or polling) rather than local state; the store-action pattern already isolates where this would be introduced.
- **Native mobile apps:** If guard adoption demands it, the guard-facing route group's feature logic (hooks, validation) is largely portable to React Native, though components themselves are not.
- **Multi-tenancy:** Current data model assumes a single guard company; production will need a tenant boundary added to every entity (Guards, Clients, Sites, Shifts) plus tenant-scoped query enforcement at the API layer.
- **Background jobs:** Missed check-in detection is currently computed client-side on a timer for the demo; production requires a server-side scheduled job so detection doesn't depend on a dispatcher's browser tab being open.

No microservices, container orchestration, or advanced DevOps tooling are anticipated at the next stage either — the recommended next step is a single well-structured monolith with a real database, scaled vertically until there's clear evidence it's needed.
